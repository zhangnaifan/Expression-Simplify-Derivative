# Expression-Simplify-Derivative
Software Engineering course lab 1/3/6/7 teamed up with @LeafyWang  
This is a command line program   
which allows users to input a string as a mathmatical expression  
and perform simplify and derivative operations.  
The program is able to detect wrong input and print warning info.  
    
Example:  
>> 3x^2*y+(2+x)*x*y    
>> 4*x^2*y+2*x*y  
>> !d/d x  
>> 8*x*y+2*y  
>> !simplify y=2 x=3  
>> 52  
>> x+u.2  
>> number presentation error!
